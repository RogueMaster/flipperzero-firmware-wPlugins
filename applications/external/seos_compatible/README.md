# 📖 Flipper Seos

Flipper app for reading and emulating Seos®-compatible cards/fobs/mobile credentials.

🎬 [Demo Video](demo.mp4)

## 🔑 Keys

**The app uses all zero keys by default**. If you'd like to use your own keys/ADF OID, use the format of the  `keys-example.txt` to specify them, and place into `SD Card/apps_data/seos/`.

- **No key files**: If no key files are present, the app defaults to all zeros (00) for keys and an ADF OID of 030107090000000000 ("0.3.1.7.9.0.0.0.0.0").  
- **keys.txt**: If `keys.txt` is present in `SD Card/apps_data/seos/`, it is automatically loaded at launch
- **Additional key sets**: Other key files named `*_keys.txt` (e.g., `work_keys.txt`, `home_keys.txt`) can be placed in the same directory and selected via the Key Switcher in the app menu

## 🛠️ To do:

- [x] Fix iso14443a-4 framing
- [x] ASN.1 for serializing/deserializing
- [x] Support for larger message wrapping/unwrapping
- [x] When parsing incoming data, use buffer + len instead of BitBuffer so I can increment buffer pointer as I parse header(s)
- [x] CMAC checking where I missed it
- [ ] Confirm the larger frame size and the block replies against a real reader

## 🧪 Tests

`make test-host` builds and runs the suite on this machine. `make test-asan`
runs it again under the address and undefined behaviour sanitisers, which is
what makes the truncation sweeps prove a parser did not read past its buffer.
`make coverage` reports what the app's own sources have covered.

## 📡 External BLE

The nRF52840 dongle is off by default. Turn it on with **External BLE** in the
main menu; the choice is saved. While it is off the dongle's stack is never
loaded and costs nothing, the scanners are hidden, and BLE emulation uses the
Flipper's own radio.

Both BLE stacks ship inside the `.fap` as plugins and are loaded only while a
BLE screen is open.

## 💡 Hardware for BLE support (experimental)

1. Install/setup Nordic SDK
1. Install Toolchain manager
1. Launch Toolchain manager
1. Next to SDK version click down arrow and "open terminal"
1. Navigate to `samples/bluetooth/hci_uart_3wire`
1. Build with `west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p auto`
1. `west flash`

## 🧪 nRF52840

1. Edit `boards/nrf52840dk_nrf52840.overlay` and change current speed to 460800 to match Flipper app.
1. `west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p auto`
1. `west flash`

## 🦝 nRF52840 dongle

1. Copy `boards/nrf52840dongle_nrf52840.overlay` to `hci_uart_3wire`
1. May need to: `nrfutil install nrf5sdk-tools`
1. `west build -b nrf52840dongle_nrf52840 -p auto`
1. `nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools pkg generate --hw-version 52 --sd-req=0x00  --application ./build/hci_uart_3wire/zephyr/zephyr.hex --application-version 1 app.zip`
1. Put dongle into DFU by pressing 'reset' button
1. `nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools dfu usb-serial -pkg app.zip -p /dev/cu.usbmodemD39BF26162261`
